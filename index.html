	<h2>About version control</h2>
	<p>In software engineering version control also known as
		"source control" is a system or class of systems responsible for recording changes to
		a file or set of files overtime in order to remember specific versions later on. 
		It gives historical versions of your project.
		when a software developer develops a software and would like to to make modifications
		to the software to make it better as time goes on the version control system will help 
		in making the modifications without loosing the older files or recover when errors occur.
		Common version control systems(VCSs) are the Local, Centralised and Distributed VCSs.
